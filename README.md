# 2D Ising Model Simulation in Fortran

This github repository tries to simulate the 2d Ising Model in Fotran. I have also written programs to simulate the same in python, both in 2D and in Quasi 3D. Please check it out if it will be useful to you  

## Usage

Set Input parameters in the `ising.in` file before execution.

## Feedback and Suggestions

I have noticed that my Ising Model program gets a few hits from students who study Physics and Cmputation from places i do not expect like Africa.

Please get in touch with me through my [Mail ID](manand881@gmail.com) and let me know as to how you are using this program and what i can do to make it better to benifit you. I'll be happy to help
